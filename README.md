The project includes the following files:

- utils.py: it defines the functions required to create the datasets and the metrics used
- network_layers.py: it defines the functions for the custom layers used in the networks
- base_unet.ipynb, attention_unet.ipynb, uc_transnet.ipynb: they contain the architecture definition and the training on the three datasets of the different models
- evaluate.ipynb: it includes the evaluation of the best models on the test set and the visualization of the results
- "Best models": the folder includes files .h5 that store the best models for each dataset and each architecture
